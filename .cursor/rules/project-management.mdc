# Rules File: Progress Tracking System

## Core Rules

1. **Always read feature.md first**
   - Read and understand the complete feature requirements
   - Identify all tasks and deliverables outlined in feature.md
   - Use this as the source of truth for what needs to be accomplished

2. **Always read progress.md before starting work**
   - Check current status of all tasks
   - Identify what has been completed
   - Identify what remains to be done
   - Avoid duplicating completed work

3. **Update progress.md after completing any task**
   - Mark completed tasks with status and timestamp
   - Add detailed notes about what was accomplished
   - Update percentage completion if applicable
   - Note any blockers or issues encountered

4. **Progress.md Structure Requirements**
   - Maintain clear task breakdown from feature.md
   - Use consistent status indicators (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
   - Include timestamps for all status changes
   - Provide brief descriptions of work completed
   - Track overall feature completion percentage

5. **Task Completion Workflow**
   - Read feature.md → Read progress.md → Complete task → Update progress.md
   - Never skip the progress update step
   - Be specific about what was accomplished in each update
   - Reference specific files, functions, or components modified

6. **Quality Standards**
   - Ensure progress updates are accurate and detailed
   - Maintain chronological order of updates
   - Keep progress.md synchronized with actual work completed
   - Use clear, professional language in all updates
