## Introduction to React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook (now Meta) and has become one of the most popular frontend frameworks in the world.

## What Makes React Special?

### Component-Based Architecture

React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Alice" />
      <Welcome name="Bob" />
      <Welcome name="Charlie" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

<Alert className="my-6">
  <Lightbulb className="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle>Key Concept</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. You describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the how.</AlertDescription>
</Alert>

### Virtual DOM

One of React's most powerful features is the Virtual DOM. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual representation of it.

When state changes occur, React:

1. Creates a new virtual DOM tree
2. Compares it with the previous version (diffing)
3. Calculates the minimal set of changes needed
4. Updates only those parts in the real DOM

This process, called "reconciliation," makes React incredibly efficient.

## When to Use React

React is ideal for:

- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** - Build fast, interactive web apps
- **Complex UIs** - Manage state across multiple components
- **Reusable Components** - Create a component library for consistent UI
- **Large Teams** - Component-based architecture scales well
